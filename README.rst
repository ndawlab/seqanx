Sequential Choice in Anxiety
============================

Anxiety disorders are characterized by a range of aberrations in the processing and response to threat, but there is little clarity what core pathogenesis might underlie these symptoms. Here we propose a decision theoretic analysis of maladaptive avoidance and embody it in a reinforcement learning model, which shows how a localized bias in beliefs can formally explain a range of phenomena related to anxiety. The core observation, implicit in standard decision theoretic accounts of sequential evaluation, is that avoidance should be protective: if danger can be avoided later, it poses no threat now. We show how a violation of this assumption - a pessimistic, false belief that later avoidance will be unsuccessful - leads to a characteristic propagation of fear and avoidance to situations far antecedent of threat. This single deviation can explain a surprising range of features of anxious behavior, including exaggerated threat appraisals, fear generalization, and persistent avoidance.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This repository hosts the :code:`sisyphus` package, which is used in all of this project's simulations. The package contains functions for constructing arbitrary MDP environments and several reinforcement learning algorithms.

To install the code through Github, open a terminal and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/ndawlab/seqanx.git

Alternately, you can clone the repository and install locally:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/ndawlab/seqanx
    cd seqanx
    pip install -e .

Once installed, the simulations (found in the notebooks folder) should be reproducible on any computer.
