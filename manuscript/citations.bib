  abstract = "Important real-world decisions are often arduous as they
              frequently involve sequences of choices, with initial selections
              affecting future options. Evaluating every possible combination
              of choices is computationally intractable, particularly for
              longer multistep decisions. Therefore, humans frequently use
              heuristics to reduce the complexity of decisions. We recently
              used a goal-directed planning task to demonstrate the profound
              behavioral influence and ubiquity of one such shortcut, namely
              aversive pruning, a reflexive Pavlovian process that involves
              neglecting parts of the decision space residing beyond salient
              negative outcomes. However, how the brain implements this
              important decision heuristic and what underlies individual
              differences have hitherto remained unanswered. Therefore, we
              administered an adapted version of the same planning task to
              healthy male and female volunteers undergoing functional magnetic
              resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine the neural basis of
              aversive pruning. Through both computational and standard
              categorical fMRI analyses, we show that when planning was
              influenced by aversive pruning, the subgenual cingulate cortex
              was robustly recruited. This neural signature was distinct from
              those associated with general planning and valuation, two
              fundamental cognitive components elicited by our task but which
              are complementary to aversive pruning. Furthermore, we found that
              individual variation in levels of aversive pruning was associated
              with the responses of insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices
              to the receipt of large monetary losses, and also with
              subclinical levels of anxiety. In summary, our data reveal the
              neural signatures of an important reflexive Pavlovian process
              that shapes goal-directed evaluations and thereby determines the
              outcome of high-level sequential cognitive processes.SIGNIFICANCE
              STATEMENT Multistep decisions are complex because initial choices
              constrain future options. Evaluating every path for long decision
              sequences is often impractical; thus, cognitive shortcuts are
              often essential. One pervasive and powerful heuristic is aversive
              pruning, in which potential decision-making avenues are curtailed
              at immediate negative outcomes. We used neuroimaging to examine
              how humans implement such pruning. We found it to be associated
              with activity in the subgenual cingulate cortex, with neural
              signatures that were distinguishable from those covarying with
              planning and valuation. Individual variations in aversive pruning
              levels related to subclinical anxiety levels and insular cortex
              activation. These findings reveal the neural mechanisms by which
              basic negative Pavlovian influences guide decision-making during
              planning, with implications for disrupted decision-making in
              psychiatric disorders.",

              consider all potential future sequences; instead, one must prune
              the decision tree. Provably optimal pruning is, however, still
              computationally ruinous and the specific approximations humans
              employ remain unknown. We designed a new sequential
              reinforcement-based task and showed that human subjects adopted a
              simple pruning strategy: during mental evaluation of a sequence
              of choices, they curtailed any further evaluation of a sequence
              as soon as they encountered a large loss. This pruning strategy
              was Pavlovian: it was reflexively evoked by large losses and
              persisted even when overwhelmingly counterproductive. It was also
              evident above and beyond loss aversion. We found that the
              tendency towards Pavlovian pruning was selectively predicted by
              the degree to which subjects exhibited sub-clinical mood
              disturbance, in accordance with theories that ascribe Pavlovian
              behavioural inhibition, via serotonin, a role in mood disorders.
              We conclude that Pavlovian behavioural inhibition shapes highly
              flexible, goal-directed choices in a manner that may be important

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Depression is characterised partly by blunted
              reactions to reward. However, tasks probing this deficiency have
              not distinguished insensitivity to reward from insensitivity to
              the prediction errors for reward that determine learning and are
              putatively reported by the phasic activity of dopamine neurons.
              We attempted to disentangle these factors with respect to
              anhedonia in the context of stress, Major Depressive Disorder
              (MDD), Bipolar Disorder (BPD) and a dopaminergic challenge.
              METHODS: Six behavioural datasets involving 392 experimental
              sessions were subjected to a model-based, Bayesian meta-analysis.
              Participants across all six studies performed a probabilistic
              reward task that used an asymmetric reinforcement schedule to
              assess reward learning. Healthy controls were tested under
              baseline conditions, stress or after receiving the dopamine D2
              agonist pramipexole. In addition, participants with current or
              past MDD or BPD were evaluated. Reinforcement learning models
              isolated the contributions of variation in reward sensitivity and
              learning rate. RESULTS: MDD and anhedonia reduced reward
              sensitivity more than they affected the learning rate, while a
              low dose of the dopamine D2 agonist pramipexole showed the
              opposite pattern. Stress led to a pattern consistent with a mixed
              effect on reward sensitivity and learning rate. CONCLUSION:
              Reward-related learning reflected at least two partially
              separable contributions. The first related to phasic prediction
              error signalling, and was preferentially modulated by a low dose
              of the dopamine agonist pramipexole. The second related directly
              to reward sensitivity, and was preferentially reduced in MDD and
              anhedonia. Stress altered both components. Collectively, these
              findings highlight the contribution of model-based reinforcement

               First, mood depends on how recent reward outcomes differ from

              release, and are known to affect momentary mood. Objective: To
              combine functional neuroimaging, computational modeling, and
              smartphone-based large-scale data collection to test, in the
              absence of learning-related concerns, the hypothesis that
              depression attenuates the impact of RPEs. Design, Setting, and
              Participants: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data
              were collected on 32 individuals with moderate MDD and 20 control
              participants who performed a probabilistic reward task. A risky
              decision task with repeated happiness ratings as a measure of
              momentary mood was also tested in the laboratory in 74
              participants and with a smartphone-based platform in 1833
              participants. The study was conducted from November 20, 2012, to
              February 17, 2015. Main Outcomes and Measures: Blood oxygen
              level-dependent activity was measured in ventral striatum, a
              dopamine target area known to represent RPEs. Momentary mood was
              measured during risky decision making. Results: Of the 52 fMRI
              participants (mean [SD] age, 34.0 [9.1] years), 30 (58\%) were
              women and 32 had MDD. Of the 74 participants in the laboratory
              risky decision task (mean age, 34.2 [10.3] years), 44 (59\%) were
              women and 54 had MDD. Of the smartphone group, 543 (30\%) had a
              depression history and 1290 (70\%) had no depression history; 918
              (50\%) were women, and 593 (32\%) were younger than 30 years.
              Contrary to previous results in reinforcement learning tasks,
              individuals with moderate depression showed intact RPE signals in
              ventral striatum (z = 3.16; P = .002) that did not differ
              significantly from controls (z = 0.91; P = .36). Symptom severity
              correlated with baseline mood parameters in laboratory ($\rho$ =
              -0.54; P < 1 $\times$ 10-6) and smartphone ($\rho$ = -0.30; P < 1
              $\times$ 10-39) data. However, participants with depression
              showed an intact association between RPEs and happiness in a
              computational model of momentary mood dynamics (z = 4.55; P <
              .001) that was not attenuated compared with controls (z = -0.42;
              P = .67). Conclusions and Relevance: The neural and emotional
              impact of RPEs is intact in major depression. These results
              suggest that depression does not affect the expression of
              dopaminergic RPEs and that attenuated RPEs in previous reports
              may reflect downstream effects more closely related to aberrant
              behavior. The correlation between symptom severity and baseline
              mood parameters supports an association between depression and
              momentary mood fluctuations during cognitive tasks. These results
              demonstrate a potential for smartphones in large-scale
              computational phenotyping, which is a goal for computational
              psychiatry.",

              safety cues (CS-) in anxiety patients compared to controls during
              acquisition. This effect may represent an impaired ability to
              inhibit fear in the presence of safety cues (CS-) and/or may
              signify an increased tendency in anxiety disordered patients to
              generalize fear responses to safe stimuli resembling the
              conditioned danger cue (CS+). In contrast, during extinction,
              patients show stronger fear responses to the CS+ and a trend
              toward increased discrimination learning (differentiation between
              the CS+ and CS-) compared to controls, indicating delayed and/or
              reduced extinction of fear in anxiety patients. Finally, none of
              the included study characteristics, such as the type of fear
              measure (subjective vs. psychophysiological index of fear), could
              account significantly for the variance in effect sizes across
              studies. Further research is needed to investigate the predictive
              value of fear extinction on treatment outcome, as extinction
              processes are thought to underlie the beneficial effects of
              exposure treatment in anxiety disorders.",

              avoidance response, an important experimental model for aversive
              learning which is also a central pharmacological model of
              psychosis. In the model, dopamine neurons reported outcomes that
              were better than the learner expected, typically coming from
              reaching safety states, and thus controlled the acquisition of a
              suitable policy. The model accounts for normal conditioned
              avoidance learning, the persistence of responding in extinction,
              and critical effects of dopamine blockade, notably that subjects
              experiencing shocks under dopamine blockade, and hence failing to
              avoid them, nevertheless develop avoidance responses when both

              Further, we often lack the information needed to precisely
              estimate the probability and value of potential outcomes as well
              as how much effort will be required by the courses of action
              under consideration. Under such conditions of uncertainty,
              individual differences in the estimation and weighting of these
              variables, and in reliance on model-free versus model-based
              decision making, have the potential to strongly influence our
              behavior. Both anxiety and depression are associated with
              difficulties in decision making. Further, anxiety is linked to
              increased engagement in threat-avoidance behaviors and depression
              is linked to reduced engagement in reward-seeking behaviors. The

              anhedonia), is known to be associated with sub-optimal
              decision-making, particularly in uncertain environments. Here, we
              use a computational approach to quantify and disambiguate how
              individual differences in these affective measures specifically
              relate to different aspects of learning and decision-making in
              reward-based choice behavior. Fifty-three individuals with a
              range of depressed mood completed a two-armed bandit task, in
              which they choose between two arms with fixed but unknown reward
              rates. The decision-making component, which chooses among options
              based on current expectations about reward rates, is modeled by
              two different decision policies: a learning-independent
              Win-stay/Lose-shift (WSLS) policy that ignores all previous
              experiences except the last trial, and Softmax, which prefers the
              arm with the higher expected reward. To model the learning
              component for the Softmax choice policy, we use a Bayesian
              inference model, which updates estimated reward rates based on
              the observed history of trial outcomes. Softmax with Bayesian
              learning better fits the behavior of 55\% of the participants,
              while the others are better fit by a learning-independent WSLS
              strategy. Among Softmax ``users'', those with higher anhedonia
              are less likely to choose the option estimated to be most
              rewarding. Moreover, the Softmax parameter mediates the inverse
              relationship between anhedonia and overall monetary gains. On the
              other hand, among WSLS ``users'', higher state anxiety correlates
              with increasingly better ability of WSLS, relative to Softmax, to
              explain subjects' trial-by-trial choices. In summary, there is
              significant variability among individuals in their reward-based,
              exploratory decision-making, and this variability is at least
              partly mediated in a very specific manner by affective
              attributes, such as hedonic tone and state anxiety.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Differentiating whether an action leads to an
               outcome by chance or by an underlying statistical regularity
               that signals environmental change profoundly affects adaptive
               behavior. Previous studies have shown that anxious individuals
               may not appropriately differentiate between these situations.
               This investigation aims to precisely quantify the process
               deficit in anxious individuals and determine the degree to which
               these process dysfunctions are specific to anxiety. METHODS: One
               hundred twenty-two subjects recruited as part of an ongoing
               large clinical population study completed a change point
               detection task. Reinforcement learning models were used to
               explicate observed behavioral differences in low anxiety
               (Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale score $\leq$ 8)
               and high anxiety (Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale
               score $\geq$ 9) groups. RESULTS: High anxiety individuals used a
               suboptimal decision strategy characterized by a higher
               lose-shift rate. Computational models and simulations revealed
               that this difference was related to a higher base learning rate.
               These findings are better explained in a context-dependent
               reinforcement learning model. CONCLUSIONS: Anxious subjects'
               exaggerated response to uncertainty leads to a suboptimal
               decision strategy that makes it difficult for these individuals
               to determine whether an action is associated with an outcome by
               chance or by some statistical regularity. These findings have
