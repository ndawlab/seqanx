              psychological and biological necessity. In this article, we
              review the literature supporting this claim and present evidence
              of a biological basis for the need for control and for
              choice-that is, the means by which we exercise control over the
              environment. Converging evidence from animal research, clinical
              studies and neuroimaging suggests that the need for control is a
              biological imperative for survival, and a corticostriatal network
              is implicated as the neural substrate of this adaptive behavior.",

  abstract = "Research suggests that the exercise of control is desirable and
              adaptive, but the precise mechanisms underlying the affective
              value of control are not well understood. The study reported here
              characterized the affective experience of personal control by
              examining the neural substrates recruited when individuals
              anticipate the opportunity to make a choice--in other words, when
              they anticipate the means for exercising control. We used an
              experimental paradigm that probed the value of having a choice.
              Participants reported liking cues that predicted a future
              opportunity to make a choice more than cues that predicted no
              choice. The anticipation of choice itself was associated with
              increased activity in corticostriatal regions, particularly the
              ventral striatum, involved in affective and motivational
              processes. This study is the first direct examination of the
              affective value of having the opportunity to choose. These
              findings have important implications for understanding the role
              of perception of control, and choice itself, in self-regulatory
              processes.",

@ARTICLE{Leotti2014,
  title     = "The value of exercising control over monetary gains and losses",
  author    = "Leotti, Lauren A and Delgado, Mauricio R",
  abstract  = "Using functional MRI, we examined how the affective experience
               of choice, the means by which individuals exercise control, is
               modulated by the valence of potential outcomes (gains, losses).
               When trials involved potential gains, participants reported
               liking cues predicting a choice opportunity better than cues
               predicting no choice opportunity--an effect that corresponded
               with blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) increases in ventral
               striatum (VS) activity. Surprisingly, no differences were
               observed between choice and no-choice cues when participants
               anticipated potential losses. Individual differences in
               subjective choice preference in the loss condition, however,
               corresponded to choice-related BOLD activity in VS. We conducted
               a second experiment to examine whether monetary losses were
               perceived differently in the context of simultaneous gains. When
               losses occurred in the absence of gains, participants showed an
               increased affective experience of choice--they reported greater
               liking of choice than no-choice trials, and VS activity was
               greater for choice than for no-choice cues. Collectively, the
               findings suggest that the affective experience of choice
               involves reward-processing circuitry when people anticipate
               appetitive and aversive outcomes, but the choice experience may
               be sensitive to context and individual differences.",

               a single alternative (i.e. a single-alternative task), and a
               task including multiple alternatives (i.e. a multi-alternative
               task). The subjects were divided into three groups and were
               exposed to three conditions. The multi-alternative task included
               two alternatives in two groups and included three alternatives
               in one group. An alternative in the single-alternative task was
               identical to one in the multi-alternative task. Amount of
               reinforcement for alternatives specific to the multi-alternative
               tasks was manipulated under three conditions in each group. When
               the amount of reinforcement was equal to or larger than that in
               the alternative common to both tasks, the subjects preferred the
               multi-alternative task over the single-alternative task. When
               amount of reinforcement was smaller, there was no difference in
               preference between the multi-alternative and the
               single-alternative tasks. In addition, the degree of preference
               for the multi-alternative task depended on the number of
               alternatives that produced larger reinforcers.",

  abstract = "Humans exhibit a preference for options they have freely chosen
              over equally valued options they have not; however, the neural
              mechanism that drives this bias and its functional significance
              have yet to be identified. Here, we propose a model in which
              choice biases arise due to amplified positive reward prediction
              errors associated with free choice. Using a novel variant of a
              probabilistic learning task, we show that choice biases are
              selective to options that are predominantly associated with
              positive outcomes. A polymorphism in DARPP-32, a gene linked to
              dopaminergic striatal plasticity and individual differences in
              reinforcement learning, was found to predict the effect of choice
              as a function of value. We propose that these choice biases are
              the behavioral byproduct of a credit assignment mechanism
              responsible for ensuring the effective delivery of dopaminergic
              reinforcement learning signals broadcast to the striatum.",
